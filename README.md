# sql-challenge--I spent multiple days attempting to get the import function to work with pgAdmin. My options are currently to go back to version 3, 
--manually insert the values into the tables or simply write the code showing that I understand the excercise but currently can't get the data into the 
--tables by no fault of my own. The import function worked the one time it was used in class but only after some odd manuvering that should have tipped me off
--as to its poor reliability. I am going to be doing the 3rd option as just imputting the title table below took a couple minutes and it is one of the smallest tables.
